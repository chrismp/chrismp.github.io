Here are some interesting facts I learned from scraping and crunching more than 14,000 video game reviews from game ratings website [Metacritic.com](http://metacritic.com).

- Video games released in the past few years are the worst of this century so far -- or at least, that's what gamers think.
- Players and game critics disagree more than ever since Metacritic began averaging scores from critics and fans.
- **Mobile phone games** are the most overrated. Critics think they are great. Players think they are either bad or just OK.
- For the newest consoles, gamers and critics disagree most on the quality of games for the **Xbox One** and **Playstation**...
- ...But critics and gamers generally agree that **Wii-U** games are pretty good.
- For the biggest video game publishers of the 2010s so far: **Activision**, **Electronic Arts** and **Deep Silver** have the worst ratings from players. **Valve Software**, **Rockstar Games** and **Telltale Games** have the best.
- For the biggest developers of the 2010s so far: **Infinity Ward**, **Sledgehammer Games** and **Treyarch** have the worst ratings from players. **CD Projekt Red Studio**, **Naughty Dog** and **Irrational Games** have the best.
- The most underrated game is **Counter-Strike: Condition Zero**, released for PC in 2004. The most overrated game is **Company of Heroes 2**, released for PC in 2013. Second place goes to **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3**, released in 2011 for Playstation 3, Xbox360 and PC.

When it comes to video games, critics' ratings matter. Game studio Obsidian Entertainment lost out on a $1 million bonus when the [Metacritic ratings](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas) for its 2012 game *Fallout: New Vegas* failed to reach 85 by one point, gaming news site *[Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/a-look-at-metacritics-many-problems-16849849440)* reported in 2013. Big publishers also consider a studio's Metascore before agreeing to pay it millions of dollars to make a video game.

But over the past 16 years, the Metacritic ratings of game critics have increasingly failed to reflect the ratings of Metacritic users. Players and critics disagree more than ever since Metacritic started in 2001 with the [stated mission](http://www.metacritic.com/about-metacritic) to "help consumers make an informed decision about how to spend their time and money on entertainment."

What follows is my analysis of more than 14,000 video games ratings from Metacritic and 321,000 critic scores. This post shows the increasing divergence between consumers and critics, which critics best reflect gamers' opinions, which critics do not, which developers and publishers consistently make the best games, and which ones consistently do the opposite. Players' opinions are defined here as Metacritic user scores.
