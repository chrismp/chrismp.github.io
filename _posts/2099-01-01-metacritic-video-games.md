Here are some interesting facts I learned from scraping and crunching more than 14,000 video game reviews from game ratings website [Metacritic.com](http://metacritic.com).

- Video games released in the past few years are the worst of this century so far -- or at least, that's what gamers think.
- Players and game critics disagree more than ever since Metacritic began averaging scores from critics and fans.
- **Mobile phone games** are the most overrated. Critics think they are great. Players think they are either bad or just OK.
- For the newest consoles, gamers and critics disagree most on the quality of games for the **Xbox One** and **Playstation**...
- ...But critics and gamers generally agree that **Wii-U** games are pretty good.
- For the biggest video game publishers of the 2010s so far: **Activision**, **Electronic Arts** and **Deep Silver** have the worst ratings from players. **Valve Software**, **Rockstar Games** and **Telltale Games** have the best.
- For the biggest developers of the 2010s so far: **Infinity Ward**, **Sledgehammer Games** and **Treyarch** have the worst ratings from players. **CD Projekt Red Studio**, **Naughty Dog** and **Irrational Games** have the best.
- The most underrated game is **Counter-Strike: Condition Zero**, released for PC in 2004. The most overrated game is **Company of Heroes 2**, released for PC in 2013. Second place goes to **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3**, released in 2011 for Playstation 3, Xbox360 and PC.

When it comes to video games, critics' ratings matter. Game studio Obsidian Entertainment lost out on a $1 million bonus when the [Metacritic ratings](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas) for its 2012 game *Fallout: New Vegas* failed to reach 85 by one point, *[Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/a-look-at-metacritics-many-problems-16849849440)* reported in 2013. Big publishers also consider a studio's Metascore before agreeing to pay it up to tens of millions to make a video game.

But over the past 16 years, the Metacritic ratings of game critics have increasingly failed to reflect the ratings of Metacritic users.
