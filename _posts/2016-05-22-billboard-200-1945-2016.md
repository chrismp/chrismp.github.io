<a href="http://billboard.com">Billboard</a> has tracked the music album sales in the United States each week since 1945. A full list of the top selling albums for each week can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_200_number-one_albums">here</a>.

I scraped the data using <a href="https://github.com/chrismp/Billboard200-top-scanner">this Python script</a>, then used <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> to make a chart showing the top-selling albums in America for each week from March 24, 1945 to May 28, 2016. Each album picture represents one week.

Scroll through the chart and mouseover each album cover for more information, or <a href="#below-chart">go to bottom</a> to read basic analysis of this data.

A few notes.

Between 1960 and August 1963, Billboard split the ranks between monophonic and stereophonic sound before merging them in August 1963. I ranked only the mono charts for that time period. 

Billboard started tracking digital sales on December 13, 2014. This includes streaming music services like Spotify, a <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6320099/billboard-200-makeover-streams-digital-tracks">post</a> on Billboard's website stated. Under the new system, when 10 tracks from an album are bought digitally, or when tracks from an album are streamed 1,500 times, it counts as a sale.
