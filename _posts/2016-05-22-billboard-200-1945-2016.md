<a href="http://billboard.com">Billboard</a> has tracked the highest selling music albums in the United States since 1945.

Between 1960 and August 1963, Billboard split the ranks between monophonic and stereophonic sound before merging them in August 1963. I ranked only the mono charts for that time period. 

Billboard started tracking digital sales on December 13, 2014. This includes streaming music services like Spotify, a <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6320099/billboard-200-makeover-streams-digital-tracks">post</a> on Billboard's website stated. Under the new system, when 10 tracks from an album are bought digitally, or when tracks from an album are streamed 1,500 times, it counts as a sale.

My chart shows the top-selling albums in America for each week between March 24, 1945 and May 28, 2016. Each album picture represents one week. 

Scroll through the chart and mouseover each album cover for more information, or <a href="#below-chart">go to bottom of the chart</a> to read some analysis of this data.
