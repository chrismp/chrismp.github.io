Gamers and critics disagree on video games more than ever in the past 16 years. 

Players' opinions on games have dropped while critics' ratings held steady, according to more than 14,000 ratings I [scraped](https://github.com/chrismp/Metacritic-video-games-scanner) from game reviews website [Metacritic.com](http://metacritic.com). The data spans ranges from 2000 to July 2016.
