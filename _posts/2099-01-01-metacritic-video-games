Here are some interesting facts I learned from scraping and crunching more than 14,000 video game reviews from game ratings website [Metacritic.com](http://metacritic.com).

- Video games released in the past few years are the worst of this century so far -- or at least, that's what gamers think.
- Players and game critics disagree more than ever since Metacritic began averaging scores from critics and fans.
- Mobile phone games are the most overrated. Critics think they are great. Players think they are either bad or just OK.
- For the newest consoles, gamers and critics disagree most on the quality of games for the Xbox One and Playstation...
- ...But critics and gamers generally agree that Wii-U games are pretty good.
- For the biggest video game publishers, Deep Silver, 505 Games and Blizzard Entertainment have the worst ratings from players. Nintendo, Valve Software and Rockstar Games have the best.
- For the biggest developers, Infinity Ward, Blizzard and Bethesda Game Studios have the worst ratings from players. CD Project Red Studio, Rocksteady Studios and Naughty Dog have the best.
