title: This map of America shows where people speak English only
---

Most Americans speak no language besides English. But in huge parts of the country, that's not the case. Many people can speak another language in the southwest bordering Mexico, in South Florida, or big cities on the East Coast and in the Midwest.

That's what I found from mapping out U.S. Census data.

While 79 percent of people in America speak English only, you can see where they don't in the map below.

To zoom in just double-click, double-tap or pinch-zoom if you're on mobile. Mouseover or tap a county to see detailed stats.

The data comes from the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, table S1601. Get the cleaned up data [here]({{site.baseurl}}/public/datasets/EnglishOnly.csv). I made the map with [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).

I also noticed the western part of my map looks kind of like the [Mexican empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Mexican_Empire).
