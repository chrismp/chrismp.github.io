When it comes to U.S. presidential elections, the only major racial group that continues to consistently vote for Republican candidates is white people. 

During elections, pollsters stand outside voting booths across America, asking voters leaving their polling places who they voted for. The results of these surveys are published and reported on by news companies. The *New York Times* has [visualized](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html) this data going back to the 1972 presidential race. Over the past 12 presidential cycles, one trend is clear. White voters are the only racial demographic in the electorate that consistently backs Republican candidates -- even when accounting for education level. 

The charts below show more.

<div id="white"></div>

First up, we see that most white voters always prefer Republicans. Whether the candidate was Ronald Reagan (1980, 1984) -- who helped grant [amnesty](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128303672) to 3 million illegal immigrants -- or Donald Trump (2016), whose immigration policies include [stripping rights](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/now-trump-administration-wants-limit-citizenship-legal-immigrants-n897931) from naturalized citizens and [jailing immigrant kids](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/11/politics/hhs-expand-tornillo-tent-facility-immigrant-children/index.html). 

Before 1972, white voters seemed to be more evenly split between Republicans and Democrats for president. Pre-election [polling](https://news.gallup.com/poll/9454/election-polls-vote-groups-19601964.aspx) from Gallup stated 51 percent of white voters in 1960 chose Republican candidate Richard Nixon over Democrat John F. Kennedy, who won. In 1964, when Democrat Lyndon Johnson won a landslide victory ([61 percent](https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1964)) against Republican opponent Barry Goldwater, 59 percent of whites reported voting for Johnson. That was likely the last time the Democrats won the white vote. In the three-way 1968 election -- between Democrat Hubert Humphreys, Republican Richard Nixon, and segregationist George Wallace -- the white vote split 38-47-15, according to pre-election [polling](https://news.gallup.com/poll/9457/election-polls-vote-groups-19681972.aspx) from Gallup. Since 1972, clear majorities of white voters have flocked to Republican candidates. The only two exceptions were in 1992 and 1996, when a big chunk of whites cast ballots for billionaire third party candidate Ross Perot. 

After Trump's 2016 win over Hillary Clinton, news outlets [reported](https://www.thenation.com/article/can-the-democrats-win-back-white-working-class-voters/) that some blamed Democrat's defeat on losing the so-called white working-class. Specifically, that meant white workers with no college degree. There seems to be some truth to that when looking at the chart below, but one thing is clear: White voters with no college degree have voted Republican for at least 36 years.

<div id="white-non-college"></div>

Like the previous chart, we see that big majorities of the white working-class vote has gone Republican for decades. The last time a Democratic presidential candidate got more than 40 percent from the white working-class was 1996. During that election and in 1992, Perot helped split the white working-class evenly between the two major parties. Since then, GOP candidates have gotten an ever-bigger share of this demographic's ballots. Trump won a record 67 percent of non-college-degree-holding white voters -- more than Reagan in his landslide 1984 victory.

Until recently, white voters who never graduated college voted similarly to their counterparts who did. See the next chart.

<div id="white-college"></div>

In every presidential election since 1980, white voters with college degrees voted mostly like the white working-class. Most cast ballots for Republicans, although at a rate of a few percentage points lower than their white voters with no degree. But since 2004, an increasing number of white college grads have gone Democrat. The biggest example is 2016, where the gap between this group and their non-college counterparts was a record 18 points -- 45 percent of white college grads reportedly chose Clinton, compared to a record low of 28 percent of degree-less whites. The exit poll states white college graduates went for Trump by a slim margin, but the *New York Times*' Nate Cohn, who covers election polling, [disputes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/upshot/trump-losing-college-educated-whites-he-never-won-them-in-the-first-place.html) that Trump won this demographic.

So that's white voters. How about smaller racial groups? I'll start with black people, perhaps the least elastic voters of America's major racial groups.
